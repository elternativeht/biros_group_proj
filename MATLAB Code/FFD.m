        % add any additional functions here
        % as a general rule, try to keep the number of operations for 
        % each method at a minimum. if a function is more than ~10 lines
        % then it should probably be split into multiple methods.
        % in general, the methods can be treated as a typical matlab
        % function with the acception of the method for passing in
        % properties. the general form for functions that have an output is
        function x = exampleFunction(obj, input1, input2)
            x = input1*obj.Re + input2*obj.Fr;
        end
        % and the general form for operations is
        function exampleOperation(obj, input1, input2)
            % updates meshed domain
            obj.rbar = 0:obj.drbar:input1;

        % where the inputs are just arbitrary variables that aren't defined
        % as properties. it is typically a good practice to limit the usage
        % of these and instead just operate with class properties. if a
        % non-property variable is being passed into multiple functions 
        % then it should instead be defined as a property.
