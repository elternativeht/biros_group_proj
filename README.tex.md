The group project for Biros

## The current project proposal

Current proposal is at the [link  (read only)][1]. The simulation process will be carried out in the rectangular region representing a 2-dimensional axis-symmetric region. Although finite volume method is the method in the proposal, possible finite difference method can be used if possible.

## Finite difference method equation discretization 

The original continuous equation is:

$$\frac{1}{\overline{r}}\frac{\partial(\overline{r}\:\overline{u}_r)}{\partial \overline{r}} + \frac{\partial \overline{u}_z}{\partial \overline{z}} = 0$$
